This is just a personal version of Quakespasm, mainly for learning and hacking around. Should build with no problems with VS2017, haven't tried building with anything else or for other platforms yet so no promises.

If you want the real Quakespasm, head to http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net

So far, changes/new features include:
* Switch between texture filtering options in Video Options menu.

You'll probably see some questionable C, I'm still new to the language. Feel free to open issues for anything that just looks awful/dangerous.

Possible goals:
* Expand on QuakeC (make new types possible, etc.)
* Re-implement software rendering.
* Add back in the fun classic exit messages.
